A better way to pause

Thanks to Kagarus' example, I've found a much simpler way to pause NPCs' movement while the player is reading text. Instead of adding an event page to each NPC checking the Messagewait switch, it's much simpler to do it with one small change to the scripts:

In class Game_Map:

Change the update_events method to this
Code:

def update_events
    if !$game_switches[1002]
      for event in @events.values
        event.update
      end
      for common_event in @common_events.values
        common_event.update
      end
    end  
  end

This still requires two changes, as I mentioned earlier, to class Window_Message. In start_message, append the line $game_switches[1002] = true. In terminate_message, append $game_switches[1002] = false.
I'm using a new switch 1002 for this, since it never has to be checked outside of the scripts.

This pauses all events, not just NPCs, which I think should be fine. As before, there is a step between messages, so looking through multiple pages (implemented as multiple messages) will allow a little movement by NPCs.
